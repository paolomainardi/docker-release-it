# Dockerised Release-it

A simple container to run release-it with a set of opinionated modules.

At the time of writing it contains (because i need it) the following dependencies:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@release-it/bumper": "^5.1.0",
    "@release-it/keep-a-changelog": "^4.0.0",
    "release-it": "^16.2.1"
  }
}
```
